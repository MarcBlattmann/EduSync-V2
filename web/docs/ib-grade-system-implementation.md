# IB Grade System Implementation

## Overview
Added support for the International Baccalaureate (IB) grade system to EduSync V2. The IB system uses a 1-7 scale where 7 is the best grade.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type System Updates
- Extended `GradeSystem` type to include `'ib'`
- Updated type definitions in:
  - `hooks/use-grade-system.ts`
  - `app/actions/grade-system.ts` 
  - `utils/grade-settings.ts`

### 2. Grade System Logic
- **Range**: 1-7 (7 is best)
- **Color coding**:
  - Green (Excellent): 6-7
  - Orange (Good): 4-5  
  - Red (Needs improvement): 1-3
- **Default grade**: 5 (good performance)

### 3. Conversion System
- Added IB conversion logic to `convertGrade()` function
- Normalizes IB grades: `(grade - 1) / 6` (0-1 scale)
- Converts to IB: `1 + (6 * normalized)`

### 4. User Interface
- Added IB option to Settings page with "7" icon and "IB (1-7)" label
- Updated Add Grade Dialog with proper label: "Grade (1-7, 7 is best)"
- Updated chart Y-axis to support 1-7 range for IB system

### 5. Utility Functions
- Updated `getGradeColor()` for IB-specific color coding
- Updated `formatGrade()` to display IB grades as whole numbers
- Updated `getGradeRange()` to return min:1, max:7 for IB
- Updated sorting and comparison functions

## Usage

To use the IB grade system:

1. Go to Settings → System → Grade System
2. Select the "7" button labeled "IB (1-7)"
3. Add grades using the 1-7 scale where:
   - 7 = Excellent
   - 6 = Very Good  
   - 5 = Good
   - 4 = Satisfactory
   - 3 = Mediocre
   - 2 = Poor
   - 1 = Very Poor

## Technical Notes

- All grades are stored in the database using the standardized 6best format
- Conversion happens automatically when displaying/inputting grades
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing grade data
- IB grades are displayed as whole numbers for authenticity

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- ✅ Grade input and validation (1-7 range)
- ✅ Grade display and formatting
- ✅ Color coding (green/orange/red)
- ✅ Chart rendering with proper Y-axis range
- ✅ Settings page integration
- ✅ Database storage and retrieval
- ✅ Grade conversion between systems
