# Automatic Semester Detection - Testing Checklist

## Pre-Testing Setup
- [ ] Development server is running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Application accessible at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] User is logged in with access to grades functionality
- [ ] At least one semester is configured in the system

## Basic Functionality Tests

### Test 1: Add Grade with Current Date
- [ ] Navigate to Grades page
- [ ] Click "Add Grade" button
- [ ] Verify semester selection dropdown is NOT present in the dialog
- [ ] Fill in subject, grade, and leave date as current date
- [ ] Submit the grade
- [ ] Check browser console for semester detection logs
- [ ] Verify grade appears in the grades table with correct semester displayed
- [ ] Expected: Grade should be assigned to the currently active semester

### Test 2: Add Grade with Specific Date in Semester Range
- [ ] Click "Add Grade" button
- [ ] Fill in subject and grade
- [ ] Set date to a specific date within a known semester range
- [ ] Submit the grade
- [ ] Check console logs for semester detection information
- [ ] Verify grade is assigned to the correct semester
- [ ] Expected: Grade should be assigned to the semester that contains the specified date

### Test 3: Edit Existing Grade with Different Date
- [ ] Click edit button on an existing grade
- [ ] Change the date to fall within a different semester period
- [ ] Save the changes
- [ ] Check console logs for updated semester detection
- [ ] Verify the grade now shows the updated semester
- [ ] Expected: Grade should be reassigned to the new semester based on the updated date

## Edge Case Tests

### Test 4: Grade with Date Outside All Semester Ranges
- [ ] Add a grade with a date that falls outside all configured semester ranges
- [ ] Check console logs for fallback behavior
- [ ] Verify grade is assigned to the active semester (fallback behavior)
- [ ] Expected: Should gracefully handle with active semester fallback

### Test 5: No Semesters Configured
- [ ] (If possible) Test with no semesters in the system
- [ ] Add a grade
- [ ] Check console logs for null handling
- [ ] Verify grade is saved with null semester_id
- [ ] Expected: Should handle gracefully without errors

### Test 6: Multiple Overlapping Semesters
- [ ] (If possible) Create overlapping semester date ranges
- [ ] Add a grade with date in the overlap period
- [ ] Check console logs for prioritization logic
- [ ] Verify active semester is prioritized
- [ ] Expected: Should choose active semester when multiple match

## Integration Tests

### Test 7: Dashboard Semester Filtering Still Works
- [ ] Navigate to Dashboard (main page)
- [ ] Verify semester dropdown is still present in Grade Overview card
- [ ] Change semester filter selection
- [ ] Verify grade statistics update correctly
- [ ] Expected: Filtering functionality should be unchanged

### Test 8: Grades Table Semester Display
- [ ] Navigate to Grades page
- [ ] Verify grades table shows semester names in the "Semester" column
- [ ] Check that semester names are displayed correctly (not "Unknown")
- [ ] Expected: All grades should show proper semester names

### Test 9: Grade System Compatibility
- [ ] Test with different grade systems (6best, 1best, IB, American, Percentage)
- [ ] Verify semester detection works regardless of grade system
- [ ] Check that grade conversion and semester detection both work together
- [ ] Expected: Semester detection should be independent of grade system

## Database Verification Tests

### Test 10: Database Storage Verification
- [ ] Add several grades with different dates
- [ ] Use browser dev tools or database client to check the grades table
- [ ] Verify `semester_id` field is populated correctly
- [ ] Confirm semester_id values match the expected semesters
- [ ] Expected: Database should contain correct semester_id values

### Test 11: Console Logging Verification
- [ ] Open browser developer console
- [ ] Add/edit grades and monitor console output
- [ ] Verify detailed semester detection logs are present
- [ ] Check for any error messages or warnings
- [ ] Expected: Clear, informative logging without errors

## Performance Tests

### Test 12: No Performance Degradation
- [ ] Add multiple grades quickly
- [ ] Verify no noticeable delays in form submission
- [ ] Check that semester detection doesn't slow down the process
- [ ] Expected: Performance should be equivalent to previous manual selection

## User Experience Tests

### Test 13: Form Usability
- [ ] Verify grade input form is cleaner without semester dropdown
- [ ] Check that form flow feels natural and intuitive
- [ ] Confirm error handling still works for other fields
- [ ] Expected: Improved user experience with simpler form

### Test 14: Error Handling
- [ ] Try submitting grade with invalid data (empty subject, invalid grade)
- [ ] Verify error messages still work correctly
- [ ] Confirm semester detection doesn't interfere with validation
- [ ] Expected: Existing validation should work unchanged

## Regression Tests

### Test 15: Existing Grade Data
- [ ] Verify existing grades (added before this implementation) still display correctly
- [ ] Check that editing old grades works properly
- [ ] Confirm semester display for existing data is accurate
- [ ] Expected: No impact on existing grade data

### Test 16: All Grade-Related Features
- [ ] Test grade deletion
- [ ] Test grade searching and filtering in grades table
- [ ] Test grade statistics calculations
- [ ] Test grade chart display
- [ ] Expected: All existing features should work unchanged

## Notes for Testers

1. **Console Logging**: Pay attention to browser console logs - they contain valuable information about semester detection process
2. **Date Formats**: Test with various date formats and edge cases (month boundaries, year boundaries)
3. **Semester Configuration**: If possible, test with different semester configurations (overlapping, gaps, etc.)
4. **Grade Systems**: Test across all supported grade systems to ensure compatibility
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Test in different browsers if possible (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Post-Testing Actions

After successful testing:
- [ ] Update documentation with any findings
- [ ] Remove or reduce console logging if needed for production
- [ ] Create user documentation about the new automatic behavior
- [ ] Plan rollout strategy if deploying to production
