# SSR Compatibility Fixes

## Fixed issues with server-side rendering (SSR)

1. **Fixed duplicate code in useIsMobile hook**
   - Removed duplicate closing bracket in the useEffect hook
   - Ensured proper cleanup of event listeners

2. **Standardized dropdown positioning with ResponsiveSelectContent**
   - Updated grades page to use the ResponsiveSelectContent component
   - Ensured consistent dropdown positioning behavior between pages
   - Prevents SSR/CSR mismatches with window object references

3. **SSR-safe window size detection**
   - All window object references now properly check for browser environment
   - Default fallback values provided for server-side rendering

4. **Improved dropdown sizing for better readability**
   - Increased minimum width from 180px to 200px
   - Increased mobile width percentage from 50% to 60% of viewport width
   - Applied consistent sizing across all pages
